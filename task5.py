# Create a variable called ```text``` to store the data: ```Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, 
# which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau.``` .
# Your task is to print the last 10 characters of the ```text``` variable on screen.

# * Your result should look like this:

# ```bash
# Last ten characters: f Spandau.

text="Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau."
